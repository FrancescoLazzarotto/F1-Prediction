# F1-Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on building **machine learning models** to predict outcomes in **Formula 1** races.  
By leveraging **historical race data** and **driver statistics**, the goal is to identify patterns and performance indicators that influence race results.

---

## Objectives

The project is structured around two core predictive tasks:

### 1. Podium Prediction (Binary Classification)
- Task: Predict whether a driver will finish **in the top 3 positions** (i.e., achieve a podium finish).

### 2. Final Position Prediction (Multiclass Classification)
- Task: Predict the **exact finishing position** of each driver in a given race, generating a full driver ranking.

## Scope and Methodology

The following steps are implemented in the project:

- **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**
  - Handling missing values, inconsistent records, and outliers
  - Normalization and transformation of relevant metrics

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Construction of new variables to capture:
    - Driver form (recent performance)
    - Team and car performance
    - Track-specific history
    - Weather or qualifying session results (if available)

- **Model Training and Evaluation**
  - Application of various classification algorithms
  - Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
  - Evaluation using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, ranking correlation)

- **Model Comparison**
  - Assessing the effectiveness of different models on **real-world race data**
  - Analysis of overfitting, generalization, and feature importance

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebooks for development and analysis
- CSV datasets containing historical F1 race data

## Learning Outcomes

This project provides insights into:

- Predictive modeling for sports analytics
- Advanced classification techniques (binary and multiclass)
- Feature extraction and engineering from time-series data
- Evaluation of models on imbalanced or competitive datasets
