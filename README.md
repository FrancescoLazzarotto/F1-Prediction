# F1-Prediction

This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict Formula 1 race outcomes. Leveraging historical race data and driver statistics, the goal is to explore patterns and performance indicators that influence race results.

üéØ Objectives
The project is centered around two main predictive tasks:

Podium Prediction (Binary Classification)
Determine whether a driver will finish in the top three positions (podium finish) in a given race.

Final Position Prediction (Multiclass Classification)
Predict the exact finishing position of each driver, providing a full ranking for the race.

üîç Scope & Approach
The project involves:

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Feature engineering (e.g., form, track history, team performance)

Training and evaluating classification models

Comparing model performance on real-world race data
